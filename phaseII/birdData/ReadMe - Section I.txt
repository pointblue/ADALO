## THIS IS THE FIRST STEP ####################

This section is about:
1) Querying the data sources (GETcadcDATA.R, loadBCORdata.R) - this includes eBird, BBS and TRBL data
2) Compiling all the data into effort and observation sets for each species (compileAllData.R)
3) Filtering by dates (based on each species' breeding and wintering periods) to produce sets that can be used to generate an empirical species range
	(filterForRangeGeneration.R)
4) Generating summaries by species (summarizeSpeciesData.R) - this helped us select the final 18 species

Next is to calculate metric4 - dependency is the 990m grid
